# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about ODIS AI and how to use it effectively.

## General

### What is ODIS AI?

ODIS AI is an AI-powered voice agent platform designed specifically for veterinary clinics. It handles inbound and outbound phone calls, schedules appointments, and follows up with pet owners—all through natural, conversational AI.

### How does pricing work?

Pricing is based on call volume and features. Contact us at sales@odis.ai for a custom quote based on your clinic's needs.

### Do I need special equipment?

No special equipment is needed. ODIS AI works with your existing phone system through call forwarding or can provide a dedicated phone number.

---

## Setup & Configuration

### How long does setup take?

Most clinics are fully operational within 1-2 hours. This includes account creation, phone number setup, and basic agent configuration.

### Can I customize what the AI says?

Yes! You can customize greetings, responses, and conversation flows through the dashboard. See our [Configuration Guide](/getting-started/configuration) for details.

### Does ODIS AI work with my practice management software?

We currently integrate with IDEXX Neo, with more integrations coming soon. Contact us if you use different software—we're always adding new integrations.

## Calls & Voice

### What happens if the AI can't answer a question?

The AI will gracefully transfer the call to your staff or take a message for callback. You can configure exactly when and how transfers happen.

### Can callers tell they're talking to an AI?

Our AI uses natural, conversational speech that many callers find indistinguishable from human staff. However, we recommend being transparent—callers appreciate honesty and the AI handles it well.

### What languages does ODIS AI support?

Currently English only, with Spanish support coming in Q2 2025.

### Can I listen to call recordings?

Yes, all calls are recorded (with appropriate consent) and available in your dashboard with full transcripts.

---

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data secure?

Yes. We use enterprise-grade encryption, SOC 2 compliant infrastructure, and strict access controls. See our [Security Page](https://odis.ai/security) for details.

### How is patient data handled?

Patient data is encrypted at rest and in transit. We're HIPAA-compliant and sign BAAs with all customers handling protected health information.

### Can I delete call recordings?

Yes, you can delete recordings at any time through the dashboard. We also support automatic retention policies.

## Troubleshooting

### Calls aren't being forwarded

1. Check your forwarding configuration in your phone system
2. Verify the destination number is correct
3. Test with a manual call to the ODIS number
4. Contact support if issues persist

### AI responses seem slow

Response time depends on several factors:

- Internet connection quality
- Current system load
- Complexity of the query

Normal response time is under 1 second. If you're experiencing delays, check your network connection and contact support.

### Integration not syncing

1. Verify API credentials are correct
2. Check that sync is enabled
3. Review error logs in dashboard
4. Re-authorize the integration
