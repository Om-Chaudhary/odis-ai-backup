      title: "Surgery Discharge Instructions Template",
      content: `
        <p>Post-surgical discharge instructions are among the most critical communications your practice delivers. A well-structured surgery discharge template ensures pet owners leave with a clear understanding of incision care, activity restrictions, medication schedules, and warning signs that warrant immediate attention.</p>

        <h3>Essential Components</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Patient and procedure summary</strong> - Include the pet's name, procedure performed, date, and attending veterinarian. This personalizes the document and serves as a reference for the owner.</li>
          <li><strong>Incision and wound care</strong> - Specify how to monitor the surgical site, whether an E-collar is required, and when sutures or staples should be removed.</li>
          <li><strong>Activity restrictions</strong> - Clearly state the duration and scope of activity limitations (e.g., no running, jumping, or stairs for 10-14 days).</li>
          <li><strong>Medication instructions</strong> - List each prescribed medication with dosage, frequency, administration method, and duration. Include whether medications should be given with food.</li>
          <li><strong>Feeding guidelines</strong> - Outline when to resume feeding, portion adjustments, and any dietary restrictions during recovery.</li>
          <li><strong>Warning signs</strong> - Provide a clear list of symptoms that require immediate veterinary attention, such as excessive swelling, discharge, lethargy, vomiting, or refusal to eat beyond 24 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Follow-up appointment</strong> - Include the date, time, and purpose of the next scheduled visit.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Formatting Best Practices</h3>
        <p>Use short paragraphs, bullet points, and bold headings to improve scannability. Avoid medical jargon where possible, and when technical terms are necessary, include a brief plain-language explanation in parentheses. Consider using a numbered timeline format (Day 1, Days 2-3, Week 1, etc.) so owners can track recovery milestones.</p>

      title: "Dental Discharge Instructions Template",
      content: `
        <p>Dental procedures, from routine cleanings to extractions, require specific aftercare instructions that differ significantly from surgical discharges. A dedicated dental discharge template addresses the unique concerns pet owners have about oral recovery, feeding adjustments, and home dental care resumption.</p>

        <h3>Key Sections to Include</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Procedure summary</strong> - Detail what was performed: scaling, polishing, extractions (specify which teeth), and any notable findings from the oral exam or dental radiographs.</li>
          <li><strong>Anesthesia recovery notes</strong> - Explain expected post-anesthesia behavior such as grogginess, mild disorientation, or reduced appetite for the first 12-24 hours.</li>
          <li><strong>Feeding modifications</strong> - Specify when to offer water and food, recommend softened food or a wet diet for 5-7 days post-extraction, and note any foods to avoid.</li>
          <li><strong>Oral care instructions</strong> - Indicate when brushing or dental chews can resume, typically 10-14 days after extractions. Describe how to rinse or apply any prescribed oral solutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Pain management</strong> - List prescribed analgesics with clear dosing instructions. Note signs of oral pain such as pawing at the mouth, drooling, or reluctance to eat.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitoring checklist</strong> - Include a simple daily checklist for the first week: appetite level, bleeding at extraction sites, swelling, and overall demeanor.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dental discharges benefit from visual aids. Consider including a simple diagram marking extraction sites so owners know exactly which areas to monitor during recovery.</p>

      title: "General Visit Discharge Template",
      content: `
        <p>Not every discharge requires the depth of a surgical template, but even routine wellness visits, vaccination appointments, and minor illness consultations benefit from a structured discharge summary. A general visit template reinforces your recommendations and gives owners a written reference they can review at home.</p>

        <h3>Template Structure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Visit summary</strong> - Brief overview of the reason for the visit, key findings from the physical examination, and any diagnostics performed.</li>
          <li><strong>Diagnoses or assessment</strong> - Document any conditions identified, using both the medical term and a client-friendly explanation.</li>
          <li><strong>Treatment plan</strong> - Outline prescribed medications, recommended therapies, or lifestyle changes. Include specific dosing instructions for any new medications.</li>
          <li><strong>Preventive care reminders</strong> - Note upcoming vaccinations, parasite prevention refills, or recommended screenings based on the pet's age and breed.</li>
          <li><strong>Next steps</strong> - Clearly state whether a follow-up visit is needed, when to recheck lab work, or what changes in condition should prompt a return visit.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For practices handling high patient volumes, a general visit template with pre-populated sections (practice contact info, standard aftercare guidelines, common medication instructions) saves significant staff time while maintaining consistency across providers.</p>

      title: "Customizing Templates for Your Practice",
      content: `
        <p>A template is only as effective as its relevance to your specific workflow and patient population. Tailoring your discharge instructions to match your practice's protocols, branding, and client demographics ensures higher compliance and a more professional client experience.</p>

        <h3>Personalization Strategies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Brand your documents</strong> - Add your practice logo, colors, and contact information to every template. Consistent branding builds trust and makes it easy for owners to identify the source when referencing instructions days later.</li>
          <li><strong>Adjust reading level</strong> - Aim for a 6th-8th grade reading level for maximum accessibility. Use readability tools to check your templates and simplify complex medical language.</li>
          <li><strong>Add species-specific variations</strong> - Create separate template variants for canine and feline patients where aftercare differs, such as activity restriction guidelines or medication sensitivities.</li>
          <li><strong>Include multilingual options</strong> - If your practice serves a multilingual community, consider offering discharge instructions in the primary languages of your client base.</li>
          <li><strong>Build in automation hooks</strong> - Structure your templates with merge fields or placeholders for patient name, procedure, medications, and follow-up dates. This enables integration with practice management software for auto-populated discharge documents.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Review and Iteration</h3>
        <p>Schedule a quarterly review of your discharge templates. Track which types of cases generate the most callback questions and update the relevant template to address those gaps. Solicit feedback from both veterinary staff and clients to identify areas where instructions are unclear or incomplete.</p>

        <p>Digital delivery of discharge instructions, via email or text message, ensures owners always have access to their pet's care plan and eliminates the problem of lost paper handouts. Practices that deliver instructions digitally also gain the ability to include links to educational videos or post-operative care resources.</p>

  faqs: [
    {
      question:
        "What should every veterinary discharge instruction form include?",
      answer:
        "At minimum, every discharge form should include the patient name and visit date, a summary of the procedure or visit findings, medication instructions with dosages and frequency, activity or dietary restrictions, warning signs that require immediate veterinary attention, follow-up appointment details, and your practice's emergency contact information. Surgery and dental templates should add procedure-specific aftercare sections such as incision monitoring or feeding modifications.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How do I integrate discharge templates with my practice management software?",
      answer:
        "Most modern practice management systems (PIMS) support template-based document generation with merge fields. Set up placeholders in your templates for patient name, procedure, medications, and dates. Your PIMS can then auto-populate these fields when generating discharge documents, reducing manual data entry and minimizing transcription errors. If your PIMS supports digital delivery, configure it to automatically email or text the completed discharge instructions to the client at checkout.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Should discharge instructions be printed or delivered digitally?",
      answer:
        "Both formats have value, and the most effective approach is to offer both. A printed copy gives the owner something tangible to reference immediately, while a digital copy sent via email or text ensures the instructions are never lost and can be easily shared with family members or pet sitters. Digital delivery also allows you to include clickable links to educational resources, medication guides, or your online appointment booking system.",
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I update my discharge instruction templates?",
      answer:
        "Review your templates at least quarterly. Track which case types generate the most follow-up calls and update those templates first to address common client questions. Additionally, update templates whenever your practice changes protocols, adds new services, or receives consistent client feedback about unclear instructions. Having a designated team member responsible for template maintenance ensures updates happen consistently.",
