      question: "How is this different from OdisAI's answering service?",
      answer:
        "Our answering service focuses on ensuring every call gets picked up — ideal for clinics that need reliable call coverage. The call center solution goes further: it handles full phone operations including multi-line management, intelligent routing between departments, overflow coverage during peak hours, and the analytics to optimize your entire phone workflow. Think of it as replacing your call center team, not just adding a backup.",

      question: "Can OdisAI handle calls for multiple locations?",
      answer:
        "Yes. OdisAI supports multi-location practices with location-specific protocols, routing rules, and PIMS integrations. Each location can have its own configuration while sharing a unified analytics dashboard.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What happens to calls that need a human — like complex medical questions?",
      answer:
        "OdisAI routes calls requiring human judgment to the appropriate staff member based on your rules. Emergencies go to on-call vets. Complex scheduling goes to your front desk. The AI handles the 70-80% of calls that follow standard patterns, so your team only deals with the ones that need them.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How does OdisAI compare to outsourced veterinary call centers?",
      answer:
        "Outsourced call centers charge $1-3 per minute and still struggle with veterinary knowledge, hold times during peak hours, and agent turnover. OdisAI costs a flat monthly rate, handles unlimited calls with zero hold time, and follows your exact protocols every time. No training new agents. No quality variance.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can we still use our front desk staff alongside OdisAI?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Most clinics use OdisAI as their primary phone system with staff handling in-person clients and complex cases. During business hours, OdisAI can handle overflow when all lines are busy. After hours, it runs everything autonomously.",
