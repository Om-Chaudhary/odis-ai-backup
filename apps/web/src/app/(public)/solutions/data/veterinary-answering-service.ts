      question: "How is OdisAI different from a traditional answering service?",
      answer:
        "Traditional answering services use human operators reading scripts who lack veterinary knowledge. OdisAI is an AI voice agent trained specifically for veterinary clinics — it understands medical terminology, integrates with your PIMS, and can actually book appointments and triage emergencies in real-time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will callers know they're talking to an AI?",
      answer:
        "OdisAI uses natural, conversational voice technology. Most callers report a seamless experience. We're transparent about being AI when asked, but the experience is designed to feel as helpful as your best receptionist.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can OdisAI handle multiple calls at the same time?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Unlike a human receptionist or traditional answering service, OdisAI can handle unlimited concurrent calls. No caller ever gets a busy signal or hold queue.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does setup take?",
      answer:
        "Most clinics are fully live within 48 hours. We configure the AI to your clinic's protocols, connect to your practice management system, and test everything before going live.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens during a power outage or internet issue?",
      answer:
        "OdisAI runs in the cloud, so it's not affected by local outages at your clinic. If anything, that's when it's most valuable — calls are still answered even when your clinic can't pick up.",
