      answer:
        "Ruby's receptionists are friendly and professional, but they can't triage a veterinary emergency, check your appointment calendar, or book a follow-up visit. For vet clinics, the ability to actually handle the call — not just take a message — matters more.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does OdisAI's pricing compare to Ruby's?",
      answer:
        "Ruby charges per minute, starting around $300/month for 100 minutes. Most vet clinics use far more than 100 minutes. OdisAI's flat pricing includes unlimited calls and is typically 40-60% less than comparable Ruby plans.",

    {
      question: "Can OdisAI be as warm and friendly as a human receptionist?",
      answer:
        "OdisAI uses natural, conversational AI designed to be warm and professional. Most callers report a positive experience. And unlike human receptionists, the quality never varies based on fatigue, mood, or training level.",
