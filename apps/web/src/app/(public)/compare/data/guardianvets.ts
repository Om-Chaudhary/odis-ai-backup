      question: "Can AI really triage as well as a licensed vet tech?",
      answer:
        "OdisAI uses veterinary-specific triage protocols to determine urgency -- whether a pet needs to be seen immediately, can wait until morning, or needs home care guidance. For the core question of \"is this an emergency?\", AI performs comparably to human triage. The difference is OdisAI answers instantly and never has a bad day.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "We like that GuardianVets uses real people. Why would we switch?",
      answer:
        "The human touch matters -- but so does answering the phone. GuardianVets technicians can only take one call at a time. During busy nights, clients wait or get voicemail. OdisAI answers every call instantly, handles unlimited callers simultaneously, and costs less. Many practices find that speed and reliability matter more than a human voice at 2 AM.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does OdisAI only work after hours like GuardianVets?",
      answer:
        "No. OdisAI works around the clock. It handles overflow during the day when your team is busy with patients, covers lunch breaks, and takes over completely after hours. It also makes outbound discharge follow-up calls and appointment reminders -- something GuardianVets does not offer.",
    },
    {
      question: "What about complex cases that need a human?",
      answer:
        "OdisAI identifies complex or high-urgency cases and routes them to your on-call veterinarian or emergency hospital immediately. You set the escalation rules. The AI handles the volume so your team only gets pulled in when it truly matters.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much can we save switching from GuardianVets?",
      answer:
        "Most practices using per-call services like GuardianVets spend $800-$2,000+ per month depending on call volume. OdisAI\"s flat pricing covers unlimited calls, appointment booking, follow-ups, and PIMS integration -- typically saving practices 40-60% while doing significantly more.",
