> "That's good to hear. The cone is definitely helping. Just keep an eye on the wound, and if you notice any significant changes or have any concerns, feel free to reach out to us. Remember, you have an appointment in 2 days. So the vet will be able to check on Harley's progress then. **If anything urgent comes up before that, don't hesitate to call us at 4 0 8 2 5 8 2 7 3 5.** Thanks for taking such good care of Harley."

**Analysis:**

- ✅ Agent mentions "urgent"
- ❌ Agent is NOT saying current situation is urgent

- ✅ This is appropriate guidance given:
  - Large wound with stitches and drainage tube
