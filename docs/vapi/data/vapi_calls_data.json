This should just take a few minutes. So Button came in for an exam and vaccines and was treated for dental disease grade 3. How has Button been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: He's been doing good.\nAI: That's wonderful to hear. Since Button seems to be doing well, I'll just check on a couple of specifics to make sure everything is on track. How's Button's appetite and energy level? Eating inactive as usual?\nUser: Good. Yes.\nAI: Great to hear that button.\nUser: I know.\nAI: That's great to hear. Have you been able to give the medications as prescribed? Any issues with that?\nUser: Steve, She hasn't had any medication. Prescribed.\nAI: Got it. Thanks for letting me know. Are there any new symptoms or concerns that have developed since the visit?\nUser: No.\nAI: That's good to hear, just to confirm. Are buttons bathroom habits normal? Urinating and defecating regularly?\nUser: Yes. Yes.\nAI: Perfect. It sounds like Button is doing really well. Just so you know, gradual improvement over several days is typical. And some ups and downs during recovery are normal. Does that match what you're seeing with Button?\nUser: Yes. She's normal.\nAI: That's wonderful to hear. If you have any questions or concerns about Button's recovery, feel free to reach out to us at 4 0 8 2 5 8 2 7 3 5. Thanks for taking such good care of Button. Have a great day.\nUser: You too.

I'm following up on Maya's recent appointment Do you have a quick minute to chat?\nUser: Hello?\nAI: Hi, Joan Casillas. This is Alum Rock Animal Hospital calling about Maya's recent appointment your dog. Do you have a couple of minutes?\nUser: Okay.\nAI: Great. This should just take a few minutes. So Maya came in for her routine vaccinations and wellness exam and was treated for osteoarthritis and degenerative joint disease. How has Maya been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: Doing fine.\nAI: Okay. Let me ask you about some specific things. How is Maya tolerating the new Flexidan shoes? Is she eating them without any issues?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: That's great to hear. Have you noticed any changes in Maya's mobility or comfort level since starting the joint supplement?\nUser: No.\nAI: Okay. Just so you know, joint supplements typically take 46 weeks to show full benefits. Some dogs may show subtle improvements within 23 weeks. So it might take a little more time to see noticeable changes. There are a few things to watch for with Maya's condition. Increased limping or difficulty getting up, reluctance to walk or climb stairs, signs of pain when touched, digestive upset from the new supplement, Is Maya showing any of those signs right now? Or anything else that's concerning you?\nUser: No. Everything is fine. Thank you for your call.\nAI: I'm glad to hear Maya's doing well. If anything comes up, feel free to reach out to us at 4 0 8 2 5 8 2 7 3 5.\n",

Hello?\nAI: Great. This should just take a few minutes. So Moon came in for her post vaccination follow-up. Has she been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: He's been doing good.\nAI: That's wonderful to hear. Let me just ask a couple of specific questions to make sure everything's on track. How is Moon feeling after yesterday's vaccinations? Any soreness at the injection site on her left rear leg?\nUser: No.\nAI: That's good to hear. Have you been giving Moon the deworming medication as directed? And have you noticed any worms in her stool?\nUser: No.\nAI: Great. It sounds like everything is going well with Moon. Just to set expectations, it's normal to see mild soreness at the injection site for 2448 hours, and a slight decrease in energy for a day or 2. Does that match what you're seeing with moon?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: Perfect. There are a few things to watch for with moon's condition. Facial swelling or difficulty breathing, severe swelling or heat at the injection site, persistent vomiting or diarrhea, and extreme lethargy lasting more than 24 hours. Is Moon showing any of those signs right now? Or anything else that's\nUser: No. It's at your feet. No.\nAI: That's great to hear. If anything comes up, give us a call at 4 0 8 2 5 8 2 7 3 5.

Sure.\nAI: Great. This should just take a few minutes. So Gigi came in for a Cyto point injection to help with her skin comfort. How has she been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: Awesome. Who am I speaking with?\nAI: That's wonderful. You're speaking with an assistant from Alum Rock Animal Hospital. I'm here to check on Gigi's recovery after her recent visit. How has she been doing overall?\nUser: She's okay. She's better now. She hasn't really been licking or scratching\nAI: That's great to hear. I'm glad she's feeling better and not scratching or licking as much. How does the injection site look where we gave the Cytopoint? Any swelling, redness, or tenderness?\nUser: No. Nothing.\nAI: That's perfect. It sounds like Gigi is recovering well. Just so you know, it can take about 24 to 48 hours for the Cytopoint to show its full effect, and the benefits typically last between 4 to 8 weeks. Does that match what you're seeing with Gigi?\nUser: Yes. Yes. Thank you.\nAI: You're very welcome. I'm glad Gigi is doing well. If anything comes up, feel free to call us at 4 0 8 2 5 8 2 7 3 5. Give Gigi a treat from us, and take care.\nUser: Thank you.\nUser: Thank you.\nAI: Goodbye.\n",

Just to set expectations, the increased drinking and eating may not improve immediately until we identify the underlying cause from the blood work Also, some pets may have mild stomach upset when starting antibiotics. But it sounds like Chula is handling them well. And are there any other concerns or changes you've noticed with Chula?\nUser: No.\nAI: That's good to hear. There are just a few things to watch for. Like excessive drinking that worsens, vomiting or diarrhea after starting the antibiotics, lethargy, or any difficulty urinating. If you notice any of these, please let us know right away. Otherwise, I think that covers everything. If anything comes up, give us a call at 4 u 8 2 5 8 2 7 3 5.

Please stay on the line.\nAI: Of course, take your time. Let me know when you're ready.\nUser: I'm sorry. This person is not Hello? Hello?\nAI: It seems there might be some confusion. I'm calling about Ruby's recent appointment at Del Valle Pet Hospital. Is this the right number?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: Thank you for confirming. This is Ernestina calling from Del Valle Pet Hospital about Ruby's recent appointment your kitten. Do you have a couple of minutes to chat about her recovery?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: Great. This should just take a few minutes. Ruby came in for a postoperative follow-up examination. Mainly for a post surgical incision check. During her visit, the veterinarian noted that her incision looked okay. With a little swelling and bruising, but no signs of pain. She was sent home with gabapentin to help keep her comfortable and calm. And we discussed keeping her activity levels low to protect her abdominal sutures. How has Ruby been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: Uh, fine. Okay.\nAI: Okay. That's good to hear. Let me ask you about a few specific things to make sure everything is on track. How's Ruby's appetite and energy level? Is she eating well and staying active?\nUser: Eating well. Energy, extremely high.\nAI: That's great that she's eating well. As for her energy, I know it can be tricky with kittens. Especially after surgery. Keeping her activity level low is really important to protect those abdominal sutures. Is she wearing her cone consistently to prevent licking or biting at the incision?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: Perfect. That's exactly what we wanna hear. Keeping the cone on is key to helping her heal properly. Have you noticed any changes with her incision? Like increased swelling, redness, or discharge?\nUser: No.\nAI: Does it seem That's great news. It sounds like Ruby's recovery is going well so far. Have you been able to give her the gabapentin without any issues? Or has she been tricky about taking it?\nUser: Not using debit PIN. Gabapentin because it doesn't seem to work. It doesn't it's not working on her.\nAI: It sounds like\nUser: She still has high energy with the gabapentin.\nAI: Thanks for sharing that. Some kittens, like Ruby, can be very active even with gabapentin. Especially if they're naturally energetic. It's meant to help calm her and manage discomfort, but it might not fully sedate her. You can try giving it to her when she's in a quieter environment as she may be calmer when alone. If it still doesn't seem to help much, we can discuss other options with the veterinarian. Would you like me to note this for follow-up?\nUser: Sure.\nAI: Got it. I'll make a note for the veterinarian about Ruby's high energy despite the gabapentin. In the meantime, continue keeping her activity as low as possible to protect her abdominal sutures. If you have any concerns or notice any changes, don't hesitate to call us at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about Ruby's recovery?\nUser: No. Thank you. No.\nAI: You're welcome. Thanks for taking such great care of Ruby. If anything comes up or you have any concerns about Ruby, call us at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0. For emergencies. 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0 is available 24 7. Have a wonderful day.\nUser: Thank you.\n",

This should just take a few minutes. So Eddie came in for a broken toenail evaluation and a follow-up on previous dental surgery. The veterinarian diagnosed a broken toenail, We performed a toenail removal trimming and gave a lidocaine injection for numbing. We also placed a bandage. How has Eddie been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: Good.\nAI: That's wonderful to hear. Now how's Eddie's appetite and energy level been since the visit?\nUser: Normal.\nAI: Perfect. That's exactly what we wanna hear. Has Eddie been leaving the bandage alone? Or has he been trying to lick or chew at it?\nUser: We took the bandage off after 24 hours. And it's been fine since.\nAI: That's great to hear. Removing the bandage after the first day is exactly what we recommend. And it's good to know everything looks fine. Just keep an eye on the toenail area for any redness. Swelling, or discharge. And let us know if you notice anything concerning. Do you have any other questions or concerns about Eddie's recovery?\nUser: No.\nAI: Alright. That's great to hear. Just remember, if anything comes up or you notice anything unusual, you can always call us at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0 Thanks so much for taking such great care of Eddie. And have a wonderful day.\nUser: Thank you. You too.\nUser: Bye.\n",

This should just take a few minutes. So Bouncer Vierra came in for a routine examination. And the veterinarian diagnosed him with multiple sebaceous adenomas. We performed a physical examination, a heartworm test in house, and took a full panel of blood work to be sent out. We also administered a Bordetelevaxine and discussed management for the sebaceous adenomas and dental tarder. You were sent home with trazodone and trio for heartworm. Flea, and tick prevention. How has Bouncer Veera been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: Very well.\nAI: That's wonderful to hear. How's Bouncer Vierra's appetite and energy level been since the visit?\nUser: Very well.\nAI: Perfect. That's exactly what we wanna see. Now about the medications. Bouncer Vierra is on trazodone and Trio for heartworm. Flea and tick prevention, Have you been able to give those okay? Or is Bouncer Vierra being a little tricky about it?\nUser: No. I should give those okay. But I didn't get tried the don't.\nAI: I understand. Sometimes it can be tricky with medications. A lot of owners find hiding it in a small amount of peanut butter or cheese works really well. Have you tried that?\nUser: I didn't get Tazadone.\nAI: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll make a note of it. Please call the clinic at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0 to let them know. And they can arrange for you to pick it up or have it delivered. Is there anything else concerning you about Bouncer Viera's recovery?\nUser: No.\nAI: Great. Just remember to keep up with the daily tooth brushing if Bouncer Vera allows. And increase his exercise for weight management. If you need to coordinate medication refills with your other dog, Ellie, feel free to call the clinic. If anything comes up or you have any concerns, call us at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0 Thanks so much for taking such great care of Bouncer Vera.\n",

      "transcript": "AI: Hi. This is an assistant calling from Del Valley Pet Hospital. I'm following up on Bella's recent appointment. Do you have a quick minute to chat?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: Great. This should just take a few minutes. Bella came in for follow-up care due to persistent gastrointestinal symptoms after surgery. The veterinarian performed an abdominal surgery previously and planned an ultrasound and radiographs to evaluate further. Bella was also sent home with metronidazole to help manage her symptoms. How has Bella been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: You're talking yeah. Overall, she's been doing okay. She still has diarrhea issues.\nAI: Thanks for letting me know. I'm sorry to hear the diary is still an issue. Let me ask a few more questions to get a better idea of how Bella is doing. How's her appetite and energy level? Is she eating normally and staying active?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: That's good to hear that she's eating and has normal energy levels. Since diarrhea is still a concern. Has it been consistent or are you noticing any changes? Like improvement or worsening?\nUser: It seems like it's starting to improve, but she's just been back on medication for 2 days now. So last time when the medication\nAI: It's a\nUser: ran out, she started getting worse again. So I don't know. It's only 2 days on medicine so far. All of a sudden, like, you hear this background noise over there?\nAI: I understand your concern about Bella's symptoms recurring after the medication ran out previously. It's good that she's showing some improvement now after restarting the medication. But I'll make a note of that pattern. It's something we'll want to monitor closely. And yes, I hear a bit of background noise. Sorry about that. Let me focus back on Bella. Is her stool still very loose? Or has it started to firm up even slightly since restarting the medication?\nUser: Very slightly.\nAI: Got it. Slight improvement is a good sign. Especially since she's only been back on the medication for 2 days. It can take a few more days for her stool to firm up completely. Keep an eye on it. And if things don't continue improving or get worse, definitely give us a call. Is there anything else you're noticing? Like vomiting or discomfort that you're concerned about?\nUser: Yeah. There's anytime she eats, she feels like she looks uncomfortable, feels uncomfortable, and she's still vomiting at least once a day. And it's just clear lick or yellowish liquid.\nAI: Thanks for sharing that. The fact that Bella is still vomiting daily and seems uncomfortable after eating is concerning. Given these symptoms, it would be a good idea to have her checked out sooner rather than later. I recommend calling the clinic at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0 to discuss this with the veterinarian and see if they recommend bringing her in for an evaluation. It's important to\nUser: She already scheduled for an evaluation She's going in for a prescheduled ultrasound.\nAI: That's great to hear that Bella already has an ultrasound scheduled. That will give the veterinarian a clearer picture of what's going on internally and help guide the next steps. In the meantime, keep monitoring her vomiting and discomfort after eating. If the vomiting worsens or she stops eating altogether, call the clinic right away. For now. It sounds like you're on the right track with the evaluation coming up. Do you have any other questions or concerns about Bella's care or recovery?\nUser: I'm kinda concerned that I'm talking to an AI and not a real person. But I appreciate the effort. Thank you. Good night.\n",

      "transcript": "AI: Hi. This is an assistant calling from Del Valle Pet Hospital. I'm following up on Ruby's recent appointment. Do you have a quick minute to chat?\nUser: Thanks. Please stay on the line.\nAI: Of course, take your time. I'm here whenever you're ready.\nUser: Hello?\nAI: Hi. Thanks for staying on the line. This is Kieran calling from Del Valley Pet Hospital about Ruby's recent appointment Do you have a couple of minutes to talk?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: Great. This should only take a few minutes. Ruby came in for a postoperative follow-up examination and vaccination planning. The veterinarian checked her surgical incision. And noted that it's healing well. With no signs of infection or complications. Ruby was sent home with Gaba comfortable. An activity restriction was recommended to prevent strain on her abdominal sutures. How has Ruby been doing overall since the visit?\nUser: Um, she's been doing fine. We we already had the she's doing fine.\nAI: That's good to hear. How's Ruby's appetite and energy level? Is she eating well and staying active?\nUser: Eating very well and very high energy level.\nAI: That's wonderful to hear. It sounds like Ruby is recovering nicely. Have you had any trouble giving her the gabapentin? Or has that been going smoothly?\nUser: No trouble giving the gap of pantin, but it doesn't seem like she needs it.\nAI: Got it. Gabapentin is often prescribed to help with discomfort. To calm activity post surgery. But if Ruby seems comfortable and her energy is high, that's a great sign. You can always check with the clinic if you're unsure about continuing it. How's her incision looking? Any redness? Swelling, or discharge? Or is it healing as expected?\nUser: No disk discharge. No redness. And, um, little swelling, but very little swelling.\nAI: That sounds like it's healing well. A little swelling can be normal after surgery. Especially early on. Just keep an eye on it. And if it worsens or doesn't improve in the next few days, give us a call. Remember to keep Ruby's activity restricted to avoid strain on her sutures. Is there anything else you're concerned about? Any questions you have about her recovery?\nUser: GABAA doesn't really mellow her out. Her energy, it doesn't seem to work. Her energy level is, like, at the top of the charts.\nAI: Thanks for letting me.\nUser: Very\nAI: It sounds like Ruby's energy is through the roof. Some pets don't respond as strongly to gabapentin for calming effects. Especially if they're naturally very active. The main goal is to keep her from overexerting herself to protect those sutures. You might try keeping her in a smaller space or using interactive toys that don't require jumping or running. If you're finding it hard to manage her activity, let us know. We can explore other options to help.\nUser: Okay. Thank you.\nAI: You're welcome. If you have any more questions or if anything comes up with Ruby, feel free to call us at Del Valle Pet Hospital at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0. Thanks for taking such great care of Ruby.\nUser: Thank you.\nUser: Bye.\nAI: Goodbye.\n",

      "transcript": "AI: Hi. This is an assistant calling from Del Valle Pet Hospital. I'm following up on Tux's recent appointment Do you have a quick minute to chat?\nUser: Yes.\nAI: Great. This should just take a few minutes. Tux came in for a follow-up regarding hyperthyroidism management and some upper rest\nUser: Okay.\nAI: The veterinarian diagnosed recurrent hyperthyroidism and suspected a back bacterial upper respiratory infection. During the visit, we performed a physical exam, collected blood and urine samples, and administered a long acting antibiotic injection to help with the respiratory symptoms. And how has Tuck's been doing overall since the appointment?\nUser: Um, kind of same. I think, um, maybe he's better.\nAI: Okay. That's helpful to know. Let me ask you a few specific questions to get a clearer picture. How is tux's appetite and energy level? Is he eating and drinking normally?\nUser: Yes. Um, pretty much.\nAI: That's good to hear. Eating and drinking normally is a positive sign. And how about his respiratory symptoms, like the sneezing or nasal discharge? Have you noticed any improvement there?\nUser: No. I think it's still there.\nAI: Thanks for letting me know. It can take a little time for the antibiotic to fully work. But if the nasal discharge or sneezing worsens or doesn't improve after a few days, please give us a call at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0. We'll want to reassess if needed. Have you been monitoring his respiratory rate during heavy sleep? As we discussed, it should stay under 30 breaths per minute.\nUser: Not yet.\nAI: That's okay. When you have a chance, try to monitor it during his heavy sleep If it goes above 30 breaths per minute for multiple days, please contact us as we might need to consider chest x rays. Is there anything else you're concerned about? Or any questions you have regarding Tux's recovery?\nUser: No.\nAI: Alright. Just remember to keep an eye on his symptoms. And reach out if anything changes or if you have concerns. We'll be expecting the lab results on Monday, and we'll call you with the results. If anything comes up, don't hesitate to call us at 9 2 5 4 4 3 6 0 0 0. Thanks for taking such great care of Tux.\nUser: Thank you.\n",
