# Documentation Index (Nx Monorepo)

Authoritative index for all documentation in the Nx workspace. This repo is a multi-package monorepo; place docs by domain and keep navigation updated when adding apps or libraries.

## How to use this index

- Start with the section that matches your task (product, architecture, API, ops).
- For new docs, pick the correct folder below and add an entry to that folder’s README.
- Do not hand-edit generated files; see the Autogenerated Assets section.

## Directory map

- `api/` – API auth, tRPC/server-action patterns, webhook guides.
- `architecture/` – System design, Nx module maps, migrations, cross-cutting patterns.
- `compliance/` – Compliance/legal requirements.
- `cursor-commands/` – Cursor/Playwright workflows and command templates.
- `dashboard/` – Dashboard UX, patterns, components, and testing notes.
- `deployment/` – Environments, CI/CD, and runtime configuration.
- `development/` – Developer workflows and local setup.
- `implementation/` – Feature or project-specific guides.
- `integrations/` – Third-party integrations (e.g., IDEXX, Retell, VAPI partners).
- `reference/` – Cross-domain references and generated inventories.
- `testing/` – Testing strategy and checklists.
- `vapi/` – Voice/call knowledge base, prompts, and VAPI-specific setup.

## Nx-aware placement rules

- Apps live under `apps/*`; document app behavior in the closest domain folder (usually `dashboard/` or `architecture/` for runtime flows).
- Libraries live under `libs/*`; add library docs to `architecture/` (design), `reference/` (inventories), or `integrations/` (external systems).
- Use Nx tags (`type:*`, `scope:*`, `platform:*`) in new `project.json` files and reflect the scope in doc titles for consistency.
- Update the relevant section README when adding or moving docs.

## Autogenerated assets

- `reference/NX_PROJECTS.md` – Nx project inventory (apps/libs, tags, targets).
- `reference/nx-projects.json` – Machine-readable inventory for tooling.
- Regenerate with `pnpm docs:nx`. Do not hand-edit the generated files.

## Priority entry points

- Product overview and workspace orientation → root `README.md`.
- Cursor rules and quick workflows → `../.cursorrules`.
- AI assistant guidance (Claude/Cursor) → `../CLAUDE.md`.
- Core library responsibilities → `architecture/CORE_LIBS.md`.
- API reference → `api/API_REFERENCE.md`.
- Testing strategy → `testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md`.

## Writing guidelines

- Keep documents concise and scoped; prefer linking to code and generated inventories.
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for guides and kebab-case for feature docs.
- Place release and migration notes in `reference/` or `architecture/` depending on scope.
