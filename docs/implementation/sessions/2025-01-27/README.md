# Implementation Session: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Initial planning and organization for the Dual-Mode API Architecture implementation project.

## Features Worked On

### Dual-Mode API Architecture

- Created feature structure and task breakdown
- Organized implementation guides into parallelizable tasks
- Set up documentation structure

**Feature Location:** [`../features/dual-mode-api/`](../../features/dual-mode-api/)

## Accomplishments

- ✅ Created comprehensive task breakdown (9 tasks)
- ✅ Organized tasks into phases with dependencies
- ✅ Created individual task guides with full context
- ✅ Set up scalable documentation structure
- ✅ Organized by features and sessions

## Next Steps

- Begin Task 1: LlamaIndex Foundation Setup
- Begin Task 4: Create Types & Validators (can run in parallel)

## Notes

- Feature documentation moved to `features/dual-mode-api/`
- Session-based notes will track daily progress
- All task guides are self-contained with full context
